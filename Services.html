      <p><h4> Enterprise Applicaiton Integration (EAI):</h4>
      <p>FAA detailed flight information ws integrated to a customers logistics software inodred to provide thier custormers real-time data for flight take-off and and landing. &nbsp;The system also tracked international flights and flight changes while tracking the payload from origin to final destination. &nbsp; </p>
      <p> Customers aging proprietary AS400 application was extended to interact with webservices in order to provide their customers a view to data that was previously only available inside the customers premises and email to the customer on a monthly schedule. &nbsp; The customer was able to see all data in real-time and was also given the ability to download reports.</p>
      <h4>Custom Software development:</h4>
      <p>Logistics compnay in the Books and Magazine business recieved bulk distributions (several pallets of the same Book or Magazine) from major printers. &nbsp; In turn they would distribute the magazine and books to several national and international customers (points of sale). &nbsp;Therefore, each customer would recieve mixed pallet(s) of magazines and books intended for their specific customers. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
      <h4>Data Architecture: </h4>
      <p>A large East Coast Power company wanted to provide its customers with dashboards that show thier power consumption compared to similar companies in the same space.  THe infrastructure was in place to recieve the raw data but they struggled to produce meaningful and interactive "what if" reports from the raw data.  A data warehouse was constructed so that reports were no longer pulled from operational data and the company was able to provide meaningful reports without interupting thier data collection.     </p>
      <h4>Project Management: </h4>
      <p>An international logistics company wanted to expand its footprint by aquiring additional warehouses and also needed a better method of financial accountability.  Their aging "in-house" WMS software was not flexible enough to accomodate the addtional warehouses and their accounting system was separate from the warehouse software and required resource intensive" manual updates that reconciled on a monthly basis for reporting.  The company selected new software for warehousing and account and asked BCV to mangage the implementation, integration, and trainikng for the new packages.  Within 6 months the company was was using the new software, able to add additional warehouses, and warehouse transactions were automatically updated thier accounting software for real-time reports.
