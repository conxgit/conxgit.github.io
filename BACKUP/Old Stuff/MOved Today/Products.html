      <h1>Our Products</h1>
      <h2>Enterprise Applcation Integration (EAI)</h2>
      <p><strong>ConXware is Business Convergence's open source intergration platform that is both intuitive and removes a large portion of integration time and resources. &nbsp;ConXdataHub creates Data Access Points (DAPs) that allow the platform to connect to any standard or non-standard software application via a login and password. &nbsp; </strong></p>
      <p>Business Convergence is dedicated to growing its products functionality 
		quickly by leveraging the Open Source user community.&nbsp; Our business 
		philosophy not only allows us to build products quicker then our 
		competitors but also presents to our customers a selection of talented 
		consultant resources they have a proven skill set with the conXwms 
		product.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
      <h2>Software Development</h2>
      <p>Software development comes in one of two flavors: &nbsp;New custom application that maps a current manual process and extending the life/functionality of a current aging core business applciation. &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
      <p>&nbsp; </p>
      <h4> IT Documents include:</h4>
      <p>Risk Assessment, Qualificaiton Plan, User Requirements, Testing protocol, Test scripts, tracability matrix (each requirement maps to a test), User Acceptance Testing, Qualificaiton Report (how well did you stick to your plan), Knowledge Transfer, Training Manuals, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), Production Support and application trianing.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>New software appliciatons: </strong></li>
Business Convergence IT Consulting services are leveraged to create an applicaiton development plan then to gather "as-is/to be" requirements based on current processes. &nbsp; Detailed documentation is generated that captures data-in and reports/data-out of the applciation. &nbsp;Once confirmed, the software development phase starts. <br />
<br />
Next the ConX platform is leveraged to rapidly prototype the most complex functionality of the new application. &nbsp;A demostration of the most complex functionality, provide our customers with confidence in our ability to deliver the complete solution at an early stage of the project.  In addition, by using the ConXplatform the new applicaiton is ready to connect to any other data source or target.<br />
<br />
Adjustments are made as needed, then the details of the applciation including the "bells and whistles" are built and tested in our QA process. <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<li><strong>Extending the life/functionality of an aging system: </strong></li>
Business Convergence IT Consulting services are leveraged to provide our customer with the alternatuves to an overhaul or the replacement of a current core business system.  Many of the older and/or proprietary software applciations are not flexible in there functionality include: providing additional reports, providing internet capability, or simply extending the functionality to capture and report on new data.
